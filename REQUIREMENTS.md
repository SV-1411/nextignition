# NextIgnition Requirements & Dependencies

To proceed with the full-scale implementation, I need the following information and API keys. Please provide them as soon as possible.

## 1. AI Integration
- **Preferred AI Provider**: (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google Gemini?)
- **API Key**: For the AI provider (OpenAI API Key, etc.)
- **Models**: Which models should we use? (e.g., `gpt-4-turbo` for summaries, `gpt-3.5-turbo` for simple tasks).

## 2. Database & Storage
- **MongoDB URI**: Connection string for your MongoDB Atlas or local instance.
- **Cloud Storage**: For pitch deck uploads and avatars (AWS S3, Cloudinary, or Firebase Storage?).

## 3. Communication

- **Push Notifications**: FCM or Expo Push token setup details (if already existing).

## 4. Mobile App (Expo)
- **Expo Project Slug**: Name of your project on Expo.
- **App Icons/Splashes**: If you have specific brand assets for mobile.

## 5. Deployment

**Note**: Please do not share these keys directly in the chat if they are sensitive. You can create a `.env` file in the root directory, and I will read from it.
